The `minimumPushes` method calculates the minimum number of key presses required to type a string `word` using a remappable telephone keypad with 8 keys. 
It first counts the frequency of each letter in the `word` and sorts these frequencies in descending order. 
To minimize presses, it assigns letters to keys starting from the most frequently used ones, with each key having the potential to be pressed up to a certain number of times. 
The total number of presses is then computed by multiplying each letterâ€™s frequency by the number of presses required based on its position in the sorted list. 
This approach ensures an optimal key mapping to minimize the overall presses.
